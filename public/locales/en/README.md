# English Translations (EN)

Translation files organized by sections for easy maintenance and readability.

## File Structure

- `common.json` - Common texts and navigation
- `hero.json` - Main section (hero section)
- `music.json` - Music selector
- `certifications.json` - Certifications and training
- `info.json` - Information section titles
- `technologies.json` - Technologies and skills
- `projects.json` - Projects (hacking and others)
- `about.json` - About me (biography and story)
- `hobbies.json` - Hobbies and interests

## Notes

Each file is independent and groups translations by thematic context.
The `i18n.js` file at the root automatically combines all these files.
