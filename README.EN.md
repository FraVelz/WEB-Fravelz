# Fravelz's Portfolio

[Version en Español](./README.md)

This is the code and documentation for my portfolio. It's my profile for companies, showcasing both the website's visual appeal and the clean, organized code structure, with corresponding and up-to-date documentation for every code change.

I'm Fravelz (Francisco Velez), a Front-End Developer. My goal is simple: to be one of the best front-end programmers in the world and eventually work at Google.

This portfolio, along with other projects that will be under construction, being improved, and completed, will demonstrate my progress and the details I consider to achieve my goal.

All web projects, whether modified, created, or last modified in 2026, will have documentation in both Spanish and English, with code comments and commits in English. This makes it a multi-language project, with English as the primary language because it's the international standard in programming. (This applies to personal projects).
