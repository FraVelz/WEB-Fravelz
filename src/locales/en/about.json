  "about_intro_text": "Hi! I'm Fravelz, a technology and programming enthusiast. Since I was a kid I've been fascinated by computers, cybersecurity, and software development.",
  "about_history_text": "At age 9 (2017) I received my first computer. I mostly used it to watch TV shows on YouTube, but everything changed the day I discovered La Geekipedia de Ernesto. Thanks to that channel, I started learning Java and soon built my first graphical interfaces.",
  "about_current_text": "I am currently focusing on frontend web development for personal projects and on ethical hacking as career preparation. Although hacking has always interested me, I am now returning to it with greater discipline and focus.",
  "about_modal_title": "Continuation - My Story",
  "about_modal_paragraph1": "I also explored his other courses, like Python and Raptor, which led me to even more resources and motivation to keep learning. Today, almost eight years after that first contact (year 2025), I remember everything as if it were yesterday. Learning about computers was a huge part of my childhood. Even though over the years I've explored very different areas and forgotten many things, I still carry faint memories of what I learned. It's like adults forgetting the details of their childhood; in my case, I keep fragments of computing knowledge that still stay with me.",
  "about_modal_paragraph2": "Hacking has always caught my attention, but because of the difficulty, technical jargon, and the limited resources I had back then, I explored other areas within computing.",
  "about_modal_paragraph3": "The areas I've explored are wide-ranging: data science (pandas, numpy), artificial intelligence (TensorFlow, Keras), hacking, web development (HTML, CSS, JS), mobile development (Flutter), desktop development (PyQt, Tkinter), and competitive programming (C, C++). I've also learned different languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, Go, Ruby, (.bat), and a few more.",
  "about_modal_paragraph4": "As the saying goes, 'jack of all trades, master of none.' I've forgotten a good part of what I learned, although some loose memories remain. In the future, once I have a bit more stability, I'd like to code again in some of those technologies. I'll revisit my older GitHub projects (some quite outdated, like Flutter apps or various experiments), refresh them, and turn them into part of my current portfolio as proof of everything I've learned beyond formal work.",
  "about_modal_paragraph5": "By the way, my current GitHub account is relatively recent (almost three years old), but I used to have one linked to an email that wasn't mine and I lost it. Even though I didn't use it much, I decided to upload those old projects here, some even with improvements. I plan to keep updating that legacy so it becomes part of my story and reflects how I've grown as a person and as a professional."
