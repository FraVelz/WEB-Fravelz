  "cert_intro_paragraph1": "My training is self-taught; I dedicate at least four hours every day to study, including practice, review, reading, and new learning. I have trained with academies such as Marcelo Vázquez's (Savitar, Hack4u) and Martín Frías's (Hixec), investing hours of practice and learning with platforms like Hack The Box (HTB), TryHackMe, Pentester Academy, among others. HTB in particular stands out for its sites and resources, even free ones, that train people in cybersecurity and ethical hacking from the basics to labs that simulate real environments.",
